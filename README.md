FirefoxProfileSelectorWithPassword
(The most effective method for me until I write a code that recognizes your face and opens the appropriate Firefox profile :))
Description:
FirefoxProfileSelectorWithPassword is a batch script to launch Firefox with different profiles based on user input. Enter the correct password to open a specific profile with predefined URLs, or the default profile otherwise. Easily customizable for different passwords, profiles, and URLs. Ideal for secure and efficient profile management.

Features:

    Password-protected profile selection
    Launches Firefox with specified profiles and URLs
    Does not display password input for secure entry
    Simple and easy-to-use interface

Usage:

    Save the script as a .bat file on your Desktop and name it Firefox.
    Change the icon to the Firefox icon:
        Right-click the Firefox.bat file and select Create shortcut.
        Right-click the new shortcut and select Properties.
        Click the Change Icon... button.
        Browse to the Firefox installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\) and select firefox.exe to use its icon.
        Apply the changes and use the shortcut to run the script.

Customization:

    Edit the correct_password variable in the script to set your own password. A quick combination that cannot be easily seen by someone nearby is recommended.
    Update the Firefox profile names and URLs in the script as needed. (For more information, see the Firefox Profile Manager)

Requirements:

    Windows operating system
    Mozilla Firefox installed

Notes:

    You can change echo Press enter to open Firefox... to echo Press enter to open Firefox....
    The default password correct_password=KLL can be changed as needed.
    echo Opening Firefox...Ya... and echo Opening Firefox...Gu.... are lines I added for me, and you can remove or modify them.
    You should adjust the "Ya" and "Gu" expressions as needed.
